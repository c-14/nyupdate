# Configure RSS-Feeds here.
# To add a feed simply add the URL in a new line.
# Warning: Currently only supports nyaa.se RSS-Feeds.
#
# Example:
#
#	http://www.nyaa.se/?page=rss&user=73859&term=Nisekoi+mkv
# 
# You can also define an 'offset'. Do this by retrieving the URL
# to the download-info page of your desired offset and extracting
# the 'tid' from it's URL. Append it to the feed's line, seperated 
# by an '@' (Feel free to add tabs or whitespaces).
# Note: This is entirely optional, you don't need to define one.
#
# Example:
#
#	http://www.nyaa.se/?page=rss&user=265&term=KILL+la+KILL @ 486307
#
# This would correspond to the offset:
#
# http://www.nyaa.se/?page=download&tid=486307
